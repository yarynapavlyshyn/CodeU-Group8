So we have implemented three classes: Point, Grid and Dictionary.
Dictionary class is actually unnecessary, but it allows to work with some words at the same time. 
To find the word there is a method in Grid findString(string) where you pass your word as 
argument and get the list of Points with all the letters in the word.
Also you can check just if the word exists by using ifWordIngrid() method.

After creating dictionary of Dictionary class you can use wordsInGrid(grid) method by passing some 
Grid instance. As a result you will get set of words in dictionary that can be formed in grid.

The function is recursive, complexity is O(n * m + l^2) where l - length of the word
                                                             m, n - size of the grid
